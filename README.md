JsonParsingChallenge
====================

This was a fun exercise that was listed by Jorin Vogel in a gist: ["https://gist.github.com/jorin-vogel/2e43ffa981a97bc17259"](JSON Challenge). I think that parsing data is a great programming exercise. 

## Running the Program

```
~$ mix deps.get
~$ mix deps.compile
~$ mix
```

This will output a CSV file with the days date as the filename.
